# Code2Vec: Non-Natural Language Processing

### Daniel Aloni (ID. 207983875), Nitzan Nehushtan (ID. 315870956) Submitted as final project for the NLP course, IDC, 2022

This project introduces a discriminative language model aimed to predict functions names given functions bodies and signatures.

Running the code is as simple as running main in the `python_model.py` file. Data is already preprocessed and stored in the `data/` folder.
